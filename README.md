🤖 Robot Motion Control - Trajectory Tracking
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of control methods for a differential drive mobile robot, focusing on trajectory tracking using a unicycle model with saturation constraints.

📁 Files Included
Main_control_code.m – Main script to run the simulation and control loop.
DiffDrive.m – Implements the differential drive robot kinematics.
Trajectory_Tracking_law.m – Contains the control law for trajectory tracking.
unicycle_saturation.m – Applies saturation limits to unicycle model inputs.
animate_robot.m – Visualization script to animate the robot’s motion.

🚀 Purpose
The project demonstrates:
Trajectory tracking control for a differential drive robot
Implementation of a unicycle model with input saturation
Visualization of robot motion along a desired path

📊 How to Run
Open MATLAB.
Run Main_control_code.m to execute the control simulation.
▶️ Use animate_robot.m to visualize the results animation.
